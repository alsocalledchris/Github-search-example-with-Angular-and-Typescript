Example use of Typescript with AngularJS hitting Github API

This project is an example of how to use Typescript with AngularJS and basic SASS. It uses Gulp and Bower for build tasks and JS dependencies and is hosted via Node.

The build tasks create a release folder with the App using mini-fied CSS and JS. Watch task is used to generate the JS and CSS files from Typescript and SASS files and should be run whilst developing.

#To run

Goto github source folder in PowerShell and run the below commands in order: 
npm install  
bower install  
gulp build  
npm start  
  
View release version under /release/index.html

(You will need bower and gulp installed globally - use "npm install gulp -g" and "npm install bower -g" if the above commands throw errors)
