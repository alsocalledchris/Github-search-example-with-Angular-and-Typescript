Example use of Typescript with AngularJS hitting Github API

This project is an example of how to use Typescript with AngularJS. It uses Gulp and Bower for mini-fication and dependencies and is hosted via a very simple .Net Core App.

To run get the latest from Github and build. To run in development mode run the Gulp task 'copyscriptsfolder' and run the watch task 'watch' to ensure changes in js and html files are picked up automatically.
